Makefile rules
--------------

To compile with each IPC type 'make IPC_name'
FIFO: make fifo
MESSAGE QUEUE: make msgqueue
SOCKETS: make sockets
SHARED MEMORY: make shmem

Type 'make clear' to permanently erase all compiled files and executable file.


Execution rules
---------------

To execute type: ./tpeSO cities_file_name company0_file_name company1_file_name ...

This program can work with up to ten companies, having at most ten planes each. Maximum quantity of medicines for each 
plane and each city is not specified, but shouldn't be over ten due to implementation of IPCs. Medicines name length 
can be 20 at most, otherwise constant MED_NAME_LENGT in file /marshalling/marshalling.c must be modified and program
recompiled. Due to differences between Unix and DOS text files, this program only works with DOS text files (carriage 
return and line break). In case of Unix cities or companies files, they can be changed to DOS by typing 'unix2dos file_names'.
